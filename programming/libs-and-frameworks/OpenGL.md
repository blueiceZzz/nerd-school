- OpenGl ES: OpenGLÂ® ES is a royalty-free, cross-platform API for rendering advanced 2D and 3D graphics on embedded and mobile systems - including consoles, phones, appliances and vehicles. It consists of a well-defined subset of desktop OpenGL suitable for low-power devices, and provides a flexible and powerful interface between software and graphics acceleration hardware. https://www.khronos.org/opengles/
- API and offers control for GUI. Cross-platform. One of a few APIs for this
- OpenGL is more of specification, defines the interfaces. It's not any code
- Every graphic card manufacture implements the OpenGL functions for themselves. So it's not really open-source. 
- Relatively easy-to-learn.
- modern OpenGL, allows much more control of the GUI. Main difference to legacy OpenGL: programmable shader. Shaders are little programs that rest on the GPU. These programs are run for each specific section of the graphics pipeline. In a basic sense, shaders are nothing more than programs transforming inputs to outputs.
- OpenGL: data -> draw something. It is a state machine.
